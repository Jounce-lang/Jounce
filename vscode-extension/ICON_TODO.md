# Extension Icon TODO

The extension requires a 128x128 PNG icon file named `icon.png` in the root directory.

## Requirements
- **Size**: 128x128 pixels
- **Format**: PNG
- **Location**: `vscode-extension/icon.png`

## Design Suggestions
- Use the RavensOne logo/branding
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use high contrast colors
- Consider dark mode compatibility

## Temporary Workaround
For testing purposes, you can:
1. Create a simple colored square with "R" text
2. Use an online icon generator
3. Extract from existing RavensOne branding materials

## Tools for Creating Icons
- Figma (free online design tool)
- Canva (easy template-based design)
- GIMP (free image editor)
- Photoshop
- Online icon generators

Once created, save as `icon.png` in this directory and remove this file.
