## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **Type Inference Implementation**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Unification algorithm requires careful occurs check to prevent infinite types
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Matching AST structure is critical - read actual AST before implementing type checker
   - ✅ **Lesson**: RefCell management needs attention to avoid borrow conflicts

2. **Reactive State Management**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Automatic dependency tracking is powerful but requires careful context management
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Fine-grained reactivity outperforms Virtual DOM for frequent updates
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Test design must avoid triggering reactivity during effect execution

3. **JSX Parsing**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Lookahead for consecutive tokens enables natural bare text syntax
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Simplifying VNode enum (removing Fragment) reduced complexity without losing functionality

4. **Animation System**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Spring physics calculations are complex but provide natural, organic motion
   - ✅ **Lesson**: CSS generation from animation configs enables seamless integration with existing styles

5. **Deployment Infrastructure**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Comprehensive documentation is as important as code
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Build scripts simplify .raven → WASM workflow significantly
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Manual steps (like Vercel login) need clear documentation

6. **Compiler Pipeline Refinement**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Edge-case test programs catch parser/lexer bugs effectively
   - ✅ **Lesson**: String handling (escapes, multi-line) is more complex than it appears
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Source map VLQ decoding requires careful bit manipulation
   - ✅ **Lesson**: LSP scope analysis benefits from parsing document AST
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Test-driven development catches issues before they reach users

### Process Insights

1. **Development Approach**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Incremental feature completion maintains momentum
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Writing tests alongside implementation catches issues early
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Regular documentation updates prevent knowledge loss

2. **Project Management**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Clear milestones (Options 1-4) provide structure and measurable progress
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Todo list tracking keeps tasks organized and visible
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Celebration of achievements maintains motivation

## Future Considerations

### Technical Exploration

1. **Server-Side Rendering Improvements**:
   - Investigate streaming SSR for large pages
   - Explore edge function deployment (Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy)
   - Consider partial hydration strategies (islands architecture)

2. **Compilation Optimization**:
   - Implement compile-time optimization passes
   - Add tree-shaking and dead code elimination
   - Explore incremental compilation for faster rebuilds

3. **Ecosystem Growth**:
   - Create component library (buttons, inputs, modals, etc.)
   - Build CLI tools for scaffolding and code generation
   - Develop testing framework for RavensOne apps

4. **Developer Experience**:
   - IDE plugins with syntax highlighting and autocomplete
   - Interactive playground for live code editing
   - Component storybook for UI development

## Implementation Best Practices

### For Future Contributors

1. **Code Quality**:
   - Write tests for new features (aim for 80%+ coverage)
   - Document public APIs with doc comments
   - Follow Rust conventions (rustfmt, clippy)
   - Update PROJECT_TRACKING.md with milestones

2. **Git Workflow**:
   - Descriptive commit messages
   - Co-authorship tags when collaborating
   - Reference issues/PRs in commits
   - Keep commits focused and atomic

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update relevant .md files with changes
   - Add examples for new features
   - Include troubleshooting sections
   - Link related documents

4. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for individual functions
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Manual testing on real browsers
   - Performance benchmarks for critical paths
